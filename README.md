This project seeks to predict the performance of football players in grassroots football using historical physical data gathered using a GPS tracking device. 
The GPS tracking device was used by two football players (a winger and midfielder) over the course of a season (2022/2023) for match and training sessions.
Using PYTHON, certain machine learning algorithms have been used for prediction for each position and for comparison.
The physical metrics considered include:
Time Played:	Duration or amount of time for training and match sessions for players
Distance (km):	The sum of the area covered during a game
Metre per Minute:	The speed at which a player covers a distance of one meter per minute.
Top Speed:	Maximum speed by a player during a session
HIRpMIN (High-Intensity Run per Minute):	Number of High-Intensity Runs / Time played
High Intensity Run(m):	Speed by a player over 19.8km
Player Position:	Position of the player while on the pitch (Wing / Midfield)
Key	Training or Match Session; 0 and 1 respectively
Number of Sprints:	Number of runs made at over 25.1km
Sprint Distance:	Distance covered at a speed over 25.1km
DISTpMIN (High-intensity Distance per minute):	Distance of High-Intensity Runs / Time played
