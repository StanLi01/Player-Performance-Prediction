# Player-Performance-Prediction
This project seeks to predict the performance of football players using historical physical data gathered using a GPS tracking device. 
The GPS tracking device was used by two grassroots football players (a winger and midfielder) over the course of a season (2022/2023) for match and training sessions.
Certain machine learning algorithms have been used for prediction for each position and for comparison.
