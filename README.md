This project seeks to predict the performance of football players in grassroots football using historical physical data gathered using a GPS tracking device. 
The GPS tracking device was used by two football players (a winger and midfielder) over the course of a season (2022/2023) for match and training sessions.
Using PYTHON, certain machine learning algorithms have been used for prediction for each position and for comparison.

# **The Dataset**

In this research, data was collected and analyzed from two players in an open age Grassroot football team over a season, spanning eight months (August 2022 – April 2023). For the analysis, two distinct positions of play are selected: Central Midfielder (CM/CDM) and Left-Wing (LW). This is independent data directly collected using the GPS tracking device in line with the ethical demand’s approval. It contains 14 Variables and 50 observations each (Training sessions and Matchday).

Some observed metrics include the Number of Sprints, acceleration, Distance covered, Sprint Distance, Number of High-intensity runs, Time played, Decelerations, Top Speed, and others. 


# **Objective**

Using machine learning, deep learning techniques, and data visualization analysis to compare the activity demands, such as the number of high-intensity runs, the amount of high-speed distance, and the distance covered by players in their different playing positions, such as Central Midfielder and Centre Forward. While there are significant positional differences in physical activity demands during competitive matches, the physical activity levels during training sessions do not show positional variations.

As the game of football keeps evolving, not just in how it is played but also in terms of the technology used, that leaves room for minor errors to win games. Performances win games; hence, it is important to evaluate player strengths and weaknesses to evaluate possible outcomes. Often, manual evaluations have left errors and prompted the need to apply an analytical and statistical model to predict performances on previous training and match sessions.
